    "## Overview\n",
    "When asked whether data science could help improve the roster this season, I approached the problem by separating performance from salary and looking for inefficiencies. Instead of starting with contracts, I started with production. The goal was simple: group players based only on how they perform on the court, and then compare their salaries within those performance tiers. That way, we can clearly see who is being paid fairly, who might be underpaid and worth targeting, and who may be overpaid relative to similar players.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build this analysis, I merged two datasets: one containing player salaries and another containing performance statistics. After combining them, I ensured that each player appeared only once and that the data was formatted correctly for analysis. Clean data is essential because clustering algorithms are sensitive to duplicates and inconsistent formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I selected performance variables that reflect overall basketball impact. I intentionally included total points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, minutes played, effective field goal percentage, and free throw percentage. Points and assists measure offensive production and playmaking. Rebounds, steals, and blocks capture defensive and physical contribution. Minutes played reflects role and usage. Shooting efficiency helps distinguish productive scorers from inefficient ones. Together, these metrics provide a balanced view of player contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, salary was not included when forming performance groups. If salary were included, the model would partially group players by contract size, which would defeat the purpose of identifying inefficiencies. Performance had to be isolated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "To form performance tiers, I used a method called clustering. In simple terms, clustering automatically groups players who have similar statistical profiles. Instead of manually labeling players as “stars” or “bench players,” the algorithm looks at patterns in the data and sorts similar players together.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested multiple grouping sizes and selected a five-cluster solution because it produced clearer separation and captured about 60% of the meaningful variation in player performance across the league. In practical terms, this means the model grouped players into meaningful tiers that align with basketball intuition: elite producers, high-level starters, strong contributors, rotation players, and lower-usage bench players."

    "## What each Cluster Represents\n",
    "\n",
    "The five clusters reflect distinct performance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 2 represents the highest production tier. Players in this group average approximately 895 points, 229 assists, and 255 rebounds while playing over 1,500 minutes. The average salary in this cluster is about $23.47 million. These are high-impact, high-usage players, superstar level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0 represents strong, well-rounded contributors. These players average about 540 points and 325 rebounds with solid minutes. Their average salary is roughly $13.8 million. These are high-level starters or two-way contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1 represents solid starters and reliable rotation players. This group averages around 444 points and 94 assists with approximately 1,000 minutes played. Their average salary is about $12 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 3 represents lower production players who, surprisingly, earn an average of about $7.39 million despite limited output (approximately 127 points and 326 minutes played).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 4 represents low-usage bench contributors with an average salary of about $4.85 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tier structure allows for fair comparisons since a star player is only compared to other star players, and a bench player only to other bench players."

    "## Methodology for Player Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "After the performance clusters were created and visualized, the next step was determining how to select players strategically. The selection process followed a two-step process. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, players were grouped strictly based on performance statistics. Salary was intentionally excluded during this stage so that financial information would not influence how players were categorized. This ensured that the clusters reflected only on-court production. Players in the same cluster therefore have statistically similar production profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, salary was reintroduced and compared within each performance cluster. For every cluster, I calculated the average salary. Then, for each player, I measured the difference between their salary and the average salary of their cluster. This created a metric called “Salary Difference.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Salary Difference = Player Salary − Cluster Average Salary**\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative salary difference indicates that a player earns less than others who perform at a similar level. A positive salary difference indicates that a player earns more than peers in the same production tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players were selected using the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Targets: Players in high-performance clusters (Clusters 0, 1, or 2) with large negative salary differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backup Options: Players in mid-tier clusters with moderate production but significant negative salary differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contracts to Avoid: Players in lower-production clusters with large positive salary differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, players were not selected because of one individual statistic such as rebounding or scoring. While visualizations use rebounds to help illustrate performance separation, the clustering algorithm considered all selected performance metrics simultaneously. A player’s selection was based on overall production relative to cost, not on a single category."

    "### High-Value Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Cluster 2, where the average salary is approximately $23.47 million, three players stand out:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Toumani Camara** earns $2.22 million while producing 734 points, 300 rebounds, and 144 assists in 56 games. He is underpaid by roughly 21.2 million relative to his performance tier.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Collin Gillespie** earns $2.29 million while contributing 718 points and 253 assists, also underpaid by approximately 21.1 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "These players were identified because their overall statistical profiles place them in a high-production tier, yet their salaries are dramatically below that tier’s average. This represents significant surplus value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong backup options in Cluster 1 include Maxime Raynaud, Jaylen Wells, and Quinten Post, each earning roughly $1–2 million while producing at levels consistent with 12 million players. These players provide great basketball performance at low cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cluster 3 reveals several inefficient contracts. The average salary in this tier is about $7.39 million, yet:\n",

    "**Bradley Beal** earns $59.0 million while producing at a level comparable to others in this lower tier, an overpayment of roughly 51.6 million relative to peers.\n",

    "\n",
    "This analysis demonstrates that performance tiers and salary tiers are not always aligned across the league. By first grouping players strictly based on production and then comparing salaries within those groups, we created a fair and structured framework for identifying financial inefficiencies. This approach prevents misleading comparisons between players with different roles and ensures that value is measured relative to similar contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings clearly show that Toumani Camara, Russell Westbrook, and Collin Gillespie are producing at levels consistent with high-tier contributors while earning a fraction of the average salary for that tier. These players represent significant surplus value and should be prioritized as acquisition targets. If those players are unavailable, Maxime Raynaud, Jaylen Wells, and Quinten Post provide strong cost-efficient alternatives that would improve roster depth without limiting financial flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, contracts such as Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Jalen Green, and Jordan Poole represent substantial salary-to-production mismatches within this dataset. While individual circumstances such as injuries must always be considered, the current performance data suggests these contracts would reduce flexibility without providing proportional impact.\n"
